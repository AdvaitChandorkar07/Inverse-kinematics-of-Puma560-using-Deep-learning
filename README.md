# Inverse-kinematics-of-Puma560-using-Deep-learning
Here in this project we are trying to find inverse kinematics solution for PUMA560 using vanilla flavoured deep neural network. Eventhough the closed form solution exist for PUMA-560 we will be finding it using deep neural network to proove that DNN(deep neural network) can be used to find inverse kinematic solution of a robotic arm

There are two set of codes one where the data is generated using conventional methods and the other where the data is generated using forward kinematics with joint restraints

The first code
There is a matlab code that gives inverse solution and writes it into a csv file using the piper solution for inverse kinematics for a 6R robot. This data generated will be used to train the model. The solution given by the matlab code is singular and if inverse kinematic solution does not exist it doesn't add it to the csv file. In this traied model the solution is biased towards the solution generated by the matlab code
